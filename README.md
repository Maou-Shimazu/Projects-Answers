<h1 align="center"> Projects Answers</h1>

### Projects Answers is a collection of various code answers from different contributors in relation to the [Projects](https://github.com/karan/Projects) repository.
#### We encourage code creativity on any answer. Certain challenges may be easy depending on the language, so how creative can you make those solutions?
#### This project is completely open source and available to anyone who wishes to contribute. The contribution guidelines are as follows.

## Contribution
- [x] Be familiar with Git and GitHub.
- [x] When adding a code solution, place it in a folder in correspondence to the solution type and section. The name of the folder should be the same as the project.
- [x] When creating a folder follow a snake case format, if it contains only 1 word, keep it lowercase. Files follow the same format, either call it by the project name + extention, or main.extention. **Only top level folders are allowed to have PascalCase names.**
- [x] Have somewhat descriptive commit and PR messages.
- [x] If you have a different implimentation for something but do not want to build upon a previous answer, add a comment at EOF and your implimentation below that to let people know there are multiple implimentations.
